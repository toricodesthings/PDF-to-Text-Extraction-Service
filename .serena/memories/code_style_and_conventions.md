# Code Style and Conventions
- Languages: Go for extraction service, TypeScript for Cloudflare Worker edge proxy.
- Error handling style:
  - JSON response envelopes (`success`, `error`, optional `code`) at API boundaries.
  - Context-aware processing with explicit timeout/limit checks.
- Service design patterns:
  - Route requests through extractor registry by MIME/extension.
  - Keep extraction result normalized (`text`, `method`, `fileType`, `mimeType`, counts, metadata/pages).
  - Use semaphores/rate controls for expensive operations.
- Security/auth patterns:
  - Internal container routes protected by `X-Internal-Auth` shared secret.
  - Worker validates object keys and proxies to container; container endpoints are intended internal-only.
