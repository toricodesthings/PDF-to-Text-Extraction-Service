# File Processing Service Overview
- Purpose: Universal file-to-text extraction service for RAG ingestion.
- Runtime architecture:
  - Cloudflare Worker in `worker/src/index.ts` (public endpoints, presign/key validation, rate-limit, container lifecycle/proxy).
  - Go container server in `cmd/server/main.go` (internal routes `/extract` and `/preview`, download temp files, MIME/extension routing, extractor invocation).
- Core extraction packages:
  - `internal/extract`: registry/router/job/result/download utilities.
  - `internal/extractors/*`: file-family specific extractors.
  - `internal/ocr`, `internal/vision`, `internal/transcribe`, `internal/hybrid`, `internal/image` for external AI-assisted extraction.
- Main docs:
  - `README.md` for API contracts and architecture.
  - `docs/UPGRADE_PLAN.md` for historical design plan and package intent.
- Tech stack: Go 1.25.x container service + Cloudflare Worker (TypeScript, Wrangler, `@cloudflare/containers`).
